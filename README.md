Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Infrastructure as Code, Microservices Integration, Service Mesh Networking, and End-to-End Monitoring

# AWS-DevOps-Project-Advanced-Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline
This project demonstrates how to set up an advanced automated CI/CD pipeline with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), microservices, a service mesh, and monitoring using AWS. Tools like Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes (EKS), Istio, Prometheus, Grafana, and ArgoCD are utilized.

## Architecture Overview
Infrastructure as Code: AWS resources are provisioned using Terraform.
Containerized Microservices: Deployed on EKS.
Service Mesh: Managed by Istio for advanced traffic control and observability.
CI/CD Pipeline: Managed with Jenkins and ArgoCD.
Monitoring: Implemented using Prometheus and Grafana.

### Pre-requisites
